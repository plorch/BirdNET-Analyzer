## Run RenameFiles.R function rnFileWithLoc() on multiple directories

For this to work you need to have a 'dir_with_dirs' that has dirs with .wav files to be renamed.

Ideally, you use this on files you have just copied off of microSD cards.

```{r running}
library(stringr)

dir_with_dirs = "C:/Users/PatrickLorch/OneDrive - SSRS/ARU_bird_callanalysis/BirdNET-Analyzer/testfiles"

rename_dir_list = list.files(path = dir_with_names, 
                              full.names = T)
lapply(rename_dir_list, rnFileWithLoc)

```
